# Buidl - SocialFi for Creators and Learners
## _A Moralis X Google Cloud Hackathon Project_

Buidl is a Social-Fi Decentralized Autonomous Organization for content creators (e.g instructors, youtubers, DIY makers, etc) basically anyone that shares their skills with other people online either for free or at a particular cost.

Today, there are various existing Web2 solutions for this particular aspect, but we are taking it further leveraging on the blockchain technology to provide a more secured, learning incentives and ownership to the community.

To become a creator on the buidl platform requires a minimum stake of 2000 BDL tokens for a minimum duration of one year, if staking is withdrawn after one year the user is not a creator anymore unstill they restake a minimum of 2000 BDL back.
A creator with suspicious activities and high report rate will be banned and their stake is locked in the smart contract, this features helps us maintain a safe community as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

## Core Features

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
